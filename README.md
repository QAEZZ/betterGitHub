# BetterGitHub (WorseGitHub)

ok, I was bored and decided to make an extension that customizes GitHub's CSS and shit. jus drag the `src.crx` file into the thingy and install it. Or you can jus load it from `manifest.json`.

This is never coming to the chrome store, I dont feel like paying the $5 registration fee when you can install it for free.

If you want a feature or something, create an issue or something, I dont know and I really dont care. Ill add it if I add it.

Green buttons have a breathing glowing effect.

Whole style is a linear gradient from the default GH color to black.

uhhh, jus go look at the screenshots.

and dont look at the css file, its awful.
all that matters is that it works frfr.

Here are some images:
